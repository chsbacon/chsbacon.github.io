title: Soldering Irons
---
Soldering iron is a tool used to connect electronics components together. The iron itself heats up to a high temperature and is used to melt solder, which is a metal alloy with a low melting point. The solder is used to connect the components together.

## Safety
Its very important to remain safe when soldering as the nature of the heat and fumes can cause harm. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind when soldering:

1. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the heat and fumes.
2. Always solder in a well ventilated area to prevent inhaling the fumes.
3. Always keep the soldering iron in its stand when not in use to prevent burns.
4. Turn off the soldering iron when not in use.


## How to solder
{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Preparation
collect all of you materials and make sure that you have a clean workspace. Its allways good practice when soldering to solder using shrink wrap and to color code your wires so make sure to have those on hand although its not reqired.

### Step 2: Placing parts
Secure your parts with a soldering helping to keep them in place while you solder this can offten be the most important part of soldering as it can be difficult to solder if the parts are not held in then right place.

### Step 3: soldering
Heat up the soldering iron and apply it to the parts that you want to solder together. Once the parts are hot enough apply the solder to the parts and let it cool.
