Soldering iron is a tool used to connect electronics components together. The iron itself heats up to a high temperature and is used to melt solder, which is a metal alloy with a low melting point. The solder is used to connect the components together.

## Safety
Its very important to remain safe when soldering as the nature of the heat and fumes can cause harm. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind when soldering:

1. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the heat and fumes.(?)
2. Always solder in a well ventilated area and **turn on the soldering fan** to prevent inhaling the fumes.
3. Always keep the soldering iron in its stand when not in use to prevent burns, **DO NOT** lay it on the soldering mat.
4. Turn off the soldering iron when not in use even when just leaving the room to grab components it will reheat quickly.


## How to solder
{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Preparation
For the initial soldering you will need a basic set of tools, at first you might think I don't need all these but you will and it's nice to have them all in front of you Instead of hunting through the lab for them.

#### A quick checklist:
1. Wire clipers
2. Wire Stripers
3. All necessary wire colors
4. A pair of small pliers(Preferably needle nose pliers)
5. A Desoldering Pumps
6. A helping hand and station
### Step 2: Placing parts
Secondly secure Your Parts into either variant of The Helping Hand for wires you'll want the Smaller metal one and for boards and other PDCBs you will use the larger plastic blue holder.For PCBs fasten them securely and face the pins at an angle towards you so it's easy to see the amount of solder on the pins. For wires Put each end of the wires you want to solder together into the Helping Hand and secure with enough wire sticking out that you can manipulate it easily and have enough space but not too much that the wires are hard to control and keep parallel to each other.Each wire should also be relatively facing a straight path you don't want to solder the wires at an angle to each other.
### Step 3: soldering

First you must tin your soldering iron. You do this by melting a little bit of solder onto the end of your soldering iron and wiping it off making sure to get all sides of the soldering iron.The solder we have in the lab is flux core so the flux will clean off the end of your soldering iron and help you tin it. If the solder instantly hardens when touching the sponge the sponge is too damp and you need to ring out some water. You want a light damp this to your sponge to make it easy to wipe off solder.You also want to repeat this step every 3 or 4 times your soldering iron touches a component to wipe off any gunk and allow easy heat transfer between the soldering iron and the solder.Next position your wires / PCB To allow for a good solder connection add a little solder ** (do not go overboard) and let it cool.

## Tips
* ### My solder isn't flowing/Uneven solder Distribution 

Normal solder flows like water when melted and like a water droplet Sticks to plastic, will connect itself to any nearby metals. One easy trick to distribute your solder evenly is to heat your solder and let it flow by itself and distribute itself onto any connected Electronics/wires. If your solder isn't flowing freely this means it's missing flux which is included in the solder(wich is fluxcore) but can dry off / Evaporate off to fix it simply heat up the “dry”  solder and add a little bit of new solder which will include flux and bring your solder back to its normal state. You will mostly encounter dry solder when you are resoldering old components.
