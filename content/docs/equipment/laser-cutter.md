### Step 1: DXF creation
Get what you want to cut as a DXF file (See [Onshape](/docs/software/onshape) for more information). Make sure that the drawing in onshape is 1:1 scale and doesnt contain any text relevant to the dimentions of the part.
### Step 2: File allocation
Put the DXF in the Print Me folder.
### Step 3: File transfer
Log into your account on the computer next to the lazer cutter and open the file onto the CUTTING SOFTWARE.

<!-- TODO: name of cutting software -->

### Step 4: Settings
Double check that the cutting dimentions are correct for the type of material that you are cutting.
<!-- TODO: add table with info on what materials settings for what materials. -->

### Step 5: Alignment
Open the lazer cutter hatch and place you part in the top left corner of the cutting bed make sure that your part is properly aligned with the corners of the bed. 
<!-- Make a diagram to show how to put the print head in the corner with lazer to align -->

### Step 6: Cutting
